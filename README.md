#####Let the cuckoo accommodate the nest for you.

CuckooJS is a scaffolding based on <a href="https://nestjs.com/" target="_blank">NestJS</a>. Inspired by the cuckoo bird, we took advantage of the already created nest and included our own easter eggs, such as:
- <a href="https://commitlint.js.org/#/" target="_blank">Commitlint</a>
- <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky" target="_blank">Husky</a>
- <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@guidesmiths/license-checker" target="_blank">License checker</a> <img alt="logo" src="https://github.com/guidesmiths/license-checker/blob/6e96b2d9a93e3838931e87f8f63af7f144811689/assets/logo.png?raw=true" width="20px" />

This way, you don't have to worry about including these when initiating a new project.

```bash
cuckoo new <projectname>
```


You can still use all the commands that work with NestJS
