## Let the cuckoo accommodate the nest for you.

CuckooJS is a project designed to facilitate the generation of scaffolding and components for your JavaScript and TypeScript applications. It is structured as a monorepo that encompasses the following packages:

- [`cuckoojs-cli`](/packages/@guidesmiths/cuckoojs-cli/README.md): A command-line interface (CLI) enabling the generation of scaffolding using various frameworks.
- [`cuckoojs-schematics`](/packages/@guidesmiths/cuckoojs-schematics/README.md): A set of Schematics to incorporate diverse functionalities and streamline the setup of your projects.

Both packages can be employed independently. In the case of `cuckoojs-schematics`, it is imperative to utilize [Schematics CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-devkit/schematics-cli). 

For more detailed information, please refer to the README of each respective package.
