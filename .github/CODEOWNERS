# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# The '*' pattern is global owners.
# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# Specify owners by their username, email, or role assignment in the project.

# More details are here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
